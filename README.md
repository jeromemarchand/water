# Water: a Raspberry pi Pico plant watering system

This is plant watering system based on a Raspberry Pi Pico.  It
activates a pump based on the reading of a soil moisture sensor. It
also have some failsafe mecanism (minimal and maximal daily amount of
water) in case the sensor is unreliable (e.g. resistive sensor have a
tendency to corrode fast).
